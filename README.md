# An Interactive Dashboard

This is an exceedingly simple and aggressively clean dashboard showing all prefectures with short descriptions and images of each, located on a map of Japan. It is hosted on https://hello-japan.netlify.app/ for demo. 

## Usage

Hover over the interactive map to get a tooltip with the prefecture and region. On clicking, the dashboard displays a short description for the selected prefecture along with an image. You may also select a prefecture from the dropdown list (grouped by regions) and the dashboard will locate it on the map for you.
